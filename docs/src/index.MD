# [ParallelReductionPipes.jl] [![Star on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/JuliaPerf/ParallelReductionPipes.jl.svg)](https://github.com/JuliaPerf/ParallelReductionPipes.jl/stargazers)
The package `ParallelReductionPipes` provides utilities to perform data reduction and visualisation tasks. This package includes a program that can extract data from a numerical simulation and provide a reducer output following the preferences of the user.

## Dependencies
`ParallelReductionPipes` relies on:
 - [ADIOS2]
 - [MacroTools]
For the configuration of pipelines, and addittionally:
 - [MPI]
 - [ParallelStencil]
For the runtime reducer to be executed. Optionally, this runtime also relies on [CUDA] for GPU reduction.
